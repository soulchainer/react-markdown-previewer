# FreeCodeCamp React Project «Build a Markdown Previewer»

This is my solution for the [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) React
challenge
[Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer).

You can check it working [here](http://soulchainer.github.io/react-markdown-previewer).

I extended my solution for this challenge far away from the user stories
required. It fulfill the user stories, but it does so much more.

Even so, is also far from perfect. It has some bugs, that start even with the
choice of a `texarea` for the editor component. I'm aware of the bunch of bugs
here, but this is a learning exercise and I needed to deliver it in some moment,
so...

Anyways, I plan to rewrite this in the future
(I left **so many features out** because of **time**), so maybe some day I will
sort that errors and get a good Markdown online editor then :D.

Like this is my very first [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) project,
I'm sticking to just React for managing the state, so not
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for now. But, maybe, I will add it later.

I have used [Lorem Markdownum](https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum) to
generate the initial Markdown file (with proper touches to include examples of
extra features).

For the iconfont, I used the extraordinary [Fontello](http://fontello.com/)
service. And, for regular fonts, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The project also has a bunch of JavaScript dependences, just check the
`package.json` for them.
